    <h1 id="level-title">How to play?</h1>
    <p>This is our unique take on our favourite <b>The Simon Game</b>.</p> 
    <p>This is an online version of the traditional game- the exciting electronic game of lights and sounds</p>
    <p> in which players must repeat random sequences of lights and sounds by pressing the colored pads in the correct order.</p>
    <p> It's fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can challenge you.</p>
